# aura-orai-ica
This is a demonstration project to show case the power of Interchain Account

Using Interchain Account, cooperation between chains can reach a higher degree.

This demonstration will invoke an ICA of MsgIBCSend between two chains:
1. Aura -> ICA{IbcSend} -> Orai -> IbcSend -> Aura
2. Orai -> ICA{IbcSend} -> Aura -> IbcSend -> Orai

This can further expand to cross - chain wasm interaction through Interchain Account
# Network
